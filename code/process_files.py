"""
process_files.py — Part 3: many files, one after another, with a running total.

The same job as process_file.py, but the app now remembers what it has already
done: how many files have been processed, how many packages that came to, and a
one-line summary of each file — and it keeps remembering across uploads.

That is the hard part, and it is hard for a specific reason: every interaction
reruns this whole script from the top, so an ordinary variable like
`files_processed = 0` is reset to zero on every rerun. Anything that has to
survive a rerun lives in `st.session_state` instead, and is initialised only
once — the first time the script runs.

The other trap is the uploader itself. Once a file has been chosen it stays
chosen on every rerun, so an app that processes "whenever there is a file" would
count the same file again on every interaction. Processing happens on a button
click instead: `st.button` is True only on the one rerun the click caused.

Run it:  Run and Debug -> "Streamlit Run: Current File"   (see README Reference #1)
Test it: pytest tests/test_streamlit.py -k process_files

# --- The page ---------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# No scaffolding. You have written two of these now, and this one does the same
# processing as process_file.py — the difference is that it remembers.
#
# What you have to work out for yourself:
#
#   - the three parts of the session-state pattern: initialise once, update on the
#     click, display from state — README Reference #6
#   - a button, key="process", so that choosing a file and clicking are two
#     different things
#   - two st.metric cards, "Files processed" and "Packages processed", side by side
#     in st.columns(2), on the page from the first run
#   - one st.info line per file processed so far, kept in a list
#
# README Step 7 names the two traps. The tests are built around them: choosing a
# file without clicking must change nothing, and a rerun with the same file still
# chosen must not count it again.
